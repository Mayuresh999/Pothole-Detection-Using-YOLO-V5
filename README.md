# Pothole-Detection-Using-YOLO-V5 ðŸš€
In this project we have made an Android Application which can detect potholes using smartphone's camera and alarm the user by making a beep sound whenever a pothole is detected.

* The application works by taking live feed from smartphone's camera and taking real-time inference on it from the YOLO V5s model. 
* THe Inference time is dependant on smartphone's processor. Better the processor, lesser the inference time.
* We also have compared the inference time on around 10 smartphones in which we found that if the processor is Snapdragon 865, the inference is very fast around (30 ms per frame).
* The application makes beep sound if a pothole is detected.

The output of model on images and videos as well as output from the app are as follows
